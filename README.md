### Hi there, I'm Russell Taylor

Iâ€™m currently learning: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit and all about Machine Learning

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: open source projects. I'm most proficient in C++, Java, and Python, but happy to learn whatever technologies are needed in order to contribute and make a difference

How to reach me: rdtaylorjr@protonmail.com

Fun fact: I enjoy running ultra-marathons and I'm passionate about advocating for children in foster care and children with special needs
