### Hi there, I'm Russell Taylor

I'm enthusiastic, detail-oriented and motivated by difficult challenges. I have previous experience leading a non-profit organization, and am finally pursuing a lifelong passion for software development.

I'm open to: contract work writing and deploying software in exchange for feedback and mentorship.

I'm proficient in: C++, Java, and Python, and I'll be happy to learn any other technologies needed in order to contribute.

Iâ€™m currently learning: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit and all about Machine Learning

How to reach me: rdtaylorjr@protonmail.com

Fun fact: I love running ultra-marathons and I'm passionate about advocating for children in foster care and children with special needs
