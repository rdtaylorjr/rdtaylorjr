### Hi there, I'm Russell Taylor

I'm looking for pro-bono contract work writing and deploying software in exchange for feedback and mentorship. I have a full-time job, so I'll be happy to work for free.

I'm proficient in: C++, Java, and Python, and I'd love to learn whatever other technologies are needed in order to contribute.

Iâ€™m currently learning: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit and all about Machine Learning

How to reach me: rdtaylorjr@protonmail.com

Fun fact: I love running ultra-marathons and I'm passionate about advocating for children in foster care and children with special needs
