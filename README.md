### Hi there, I'm Russell Taylor

I have a bachelor of science in Computer Science and plan to begin a master's degree in Computer Science at Georgia Tech next Fall. I am proficient in C++, Java, and Python, and have worked with a variety of other languages and technologies. I have a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms, and I appreciate code that is clean, elegant, and robust.

Prior to pursuing a career in software development, I was an academic researcher specializing in Ancient Middle Eastern Languages. As part of that work, I created and maintained complex, highly-specialized right-to-left language datasets optimized for natural language processing. Those datasets enabled comprehensive syntactic tagging of ancient texts, and led to several new discoveries about ancient middle eastern linguistics, history, and culture.

When I am not coding, you will often find me running. Last February, I ran my first 100 mile ultra-marathon. Ultra running is fundamentally about adapting to and overcoming a stream of unexpected problems and challenges. It has taught me how to solve problems well, and I believe that solving problems well is the key to writing excellent code.

Thanks for stopping by! I'd love to hear from you if you have any feedback or if you're interested in collaborating on any projects!
