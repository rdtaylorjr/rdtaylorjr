### Thanks for stopping by!

I'm a software engineer at Nielsen and a graduate student at Georgia Tech, specializing in high performance computing systems. 

Before I became a software engineer, I was an academic researcher studying ancient near eastern languages. As part of that work, I created and maintained complex, highly-specialized right-to-left language datasets optimized for linguistic analysis.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy trail running in the Colorado mountains. I've run several ultra-marathons including a couple 100 milers. Ultra running is proof that any problem can be solved with enough preparation, adaptation, and determination... and I find that mindset super helpful when writing code.

I would love to connect with you and collaborate on any interesting projects! Have an awesome day!
